This is what the Lord says: <br/>
“A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, <br/>
Rachel weeping for her children <br/>
and refusing to be comforted, <br/>
because they are no more.”

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">15</span>
耶和華如此說： <br/>
在拉瑪聽見號咷痛哭的聲音， <br/>
是拉結哭他兒女，不肯受安慰， <br/>
因為他們都不在了。

This is what the Lord says: <br/>
“Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, <br/>
for your work will be rewarded,” declares the Lord.

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">16</span>
耶和華如此說： <br/>
你禁止聲音不要哀哭，禁止眼目不要流淚， <br/>
因你所做之工必有賞賜；

“They will return from the land of the enemy. <br/>
<span class="ref">17</span>
So there is hope for your descendants,” <br/>
declares the Lord. <br/>
“Your children will return to their own land.

<div class="zh">
他們必從敵國歸回。這是耶和華說的。 <br/>

“I have surely heard Ephraim’s moaning: <br/>
‘You disciplined me like an unruly calf, <br/>
and I have been disciplined. <br/>
Restore me, and I will return, <br/>
because you are the Lord my God.

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">18</span>
我聽見以法蓮為自己悲歎說： <br/>
你責罰我，我便受責罰， <br/>
像不慣負軛的牛犢一樣。 <br/>
求你使我回轉，我便回轉， <br/>
因為你是耶和華─我的神。
</div>

<span class="ref">19</span>
After I strayed, I repented; <br/>
after I came to understand, I beat my breast. <br/>
I was ashamed and humiliated <br/>
because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">19</span>
我回轉以後就真正懊悔； <br/>
受教以後就拍腿歎息； <br/>
我因擔當幼年的凌辱就抱愧蒙羞。

<span class="ref">20</span>
Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? <br/>
Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. <br/>
Therefore my heart yearns for him; <br/>
I have great compassion for him,” declares the Lord.

<div class="zh">
<span class="ref">20</span>
耶和華說：以法蓮是我的愛子麼？ <br/>
是可喜悅的孩子麼？ <br/>
我每逢責備他， 仍深顧念他； <br/>
所以我的心腸戀慕他； 我必要憐憫他。
